     The curve is voisr/logo_wave.py's small one, because the mark is 26 px. At
     clock 0 this draws exactly what index.html already holds, which is the
     logo itself and what reduced motion keeps showing.

     The app stays resident, so it stops whenever the window is hidden or not
     focused, or while the mark has no box (first run hides the shell), and
     holds its frame until it can resume. After V.idle's wait
     without input it eases to a stop as well. wave.js runs the banner under the
     same rules, but its loop is built around the banner's three lines.

     This runs on a timer because a frame callback wakes the page on every frame
     of the display, drawn or not: for the same 20 drawings a second that cost
     about 17% of a core against 13%. */
