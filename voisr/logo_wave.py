"""The Ribbon sound wave: the one curve behind every Voisr logo.

The app icon, assets/logo.svg, the tray icon and the sidebar's mark all draw
from here, on a 100-unit box:

    y = 50 + 30 * sin(pi*u)^1.25 * sin(2*pi*c*u + phi),  x from 10 to 90

Below a certain size the full wave closes up into a smear, so small sizes use
a different curve rather than a scaled-down copy.

Imports nothing beyond the standard library: voisr/logo.py draws it for the
tray and the icon script, and the geometry must be the same as the Mac app's.
